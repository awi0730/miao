  < h1 >午后的教室里，可3 was holding his legs crossed and occupying the seat of 22 , turning his pen in his hand, looking at 22 standing beside him with a proud look on his face . 22 Purple his lips, and a trace of stubbornness flashed in his eyes.

"Get out of the way." 22 whispered.

But 3 covered his chest exaggeratedly: "Wow, 22 will resist? I'm so scared-" She deliberately dragged the tone and even gave a wink at 66 , " 66 , look at her being raped me!"

66 was fighting with math homework, and didn't raise his head: "...I've calculated this question three times and it's still wrong..."

22 Take a deep breath and suddenly sits on Ke's legs.

"Wow—!" But 3 was caught off guard and almost broke out of breath, " 22 ! You—you are so heavy!"

22 took out the textbook expressionlessly, sat steadily on Ke's legs, and even leaned back: "If you don't give up your seat, then that's it."

But 3 struggled twice and found that he could not push at all - 22 suppressed But 3 with absolute physical advantage , and did not move at all.

Yu Bo just came back from the toilet and saw this scene as soon as he entered the door. He immediately possessed the drama spirit and covered his mouth and exclaimed: "Oh my God! But 3 , you were 'forcibly married' by 22 ?!"

But 3 blushed, shy and annoyed: " 22 ! Get up!"

22 calmly turned a page of the book: "No."

Yu Bo jumped over and poked Ke3 's face: "Oh, Ke3's face turned red! Is his heartbeat faster?"

But 3 was so angry that he was embarrassed: "Yu Bo! If you talk nonsense, I will—"

"Just what?" Yu Bo smiled and got closer, "I asked Ms. Anonymous to punish me to copy the formula? Or... ignore me?"

But 3 words are speechless, 22 moves silently to the side to make room for Yu Bo. Yu Bo squeezed between Ke3 and 22 , hugged Ke3 's neck, and whispered in her ear: "Actually... you look cute when you are shy."

But 3 was instantly furious: "Who is shy! Why are you all so annoying!"

66 finally gave up his math homework and held his cheek to watch the show: "Hehe, you have a happy marriage for a hundred years!"

22 hummed gently and raised the corners of his mouth slightly.

Outside the window, an anonymous lady walked by with her lesson plan in her arms, caught a glimpse of the noisy scene in the classroom, and shook her head helplessly: "This group of children..." </h1 >
